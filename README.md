# Escape-the-Labyrinth
CS 211 Class Project

Description
This project implements and explores pointer-based mazes in C++, focusing on dynamic memory management and debugging linked structures. Tasks include building a templated Grid<T> class, validating escape paths, and solving custom labyrinths using gdb.

Features
Templated Grid Class: Implements a 2D grid with dynamic memory, supporting arbitrary data types.
Maze Navigation: Validates paths in pointer-based mazes to collect items and escape.
Debugging with gdb: Maps and solves custom labyrinths, leveraging memory addresses and pointer traversal.

Skills Practiced
Dynamic memory allocation and deallocation
Linked structures and pointer manipulation
Debugging with gdb
